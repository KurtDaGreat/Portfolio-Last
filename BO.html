		    <td> LESSON 1: Events <br> What are Events?
A function does nothing unless it is called. This is where
the event handlers comes into play. You can have a dozen
of the cool JS functions on your page, but without event
handlers to call them at the most appropriate time, they
remain just a block of text.
Using event handlers, you can respond to an event on your
page.   </td>

 In JS, conditional statements perform different actions for
different decisions.
If Statement
The “If Statement” is used to check or verify a condition and
execute a set of statements only if the condition is true. This
should be referred as a statement and not as a function.
The If statement is one of the most popular and most important
conditional constructs in JS and in many other programming
languages. This conditional statement construct evaluates a
condition to True or False. It then runs a specific code depending
on the result of this evaluation.

Nested If Statement
Nested If statement is like an “if statement” with another “if
statement” just like a parent and a child. Nested if is used when
“child” condition is only checked when the parent condition is true.
For example, in purchasing a car, first the car color is verified if it
looks good, only if it satisfies the parent condition which is the price
and goes on to a more superior condition.
<br> If-Else Statement
If-Else statement has also the same format as “if statement”. The
only thing, is that an Else part is added to an If statement. So, if the
condition satisfies the statement inside an If statement, part of the
code will be executed. And Else statement inside Else part only will
be executed.
The If-Else statement is similar to the If statement, except that we
are giving an alternative instruction in case the arguments isn’t
TRUE.

		    <td> LESSON 3: Conditions, Controls and Loops <br> Functions:
A function is a self-contained piece of code that performs a
particular “function” when it is called and it is also a set of
statement or blocks of codes combined together for a particular
use, also known as method. It is usually used so that you will not
have to retype your codes again when you need them, all you have
to do is to call it and execute it.
A function can be called anywhere within the page or even from an
external JS file. Functions can be defined anywhere in the head
section or body section; however, it is ideal to put the function in
the head section so that you are assured that it is loaded properly </td>

What is a Loop?
There are times when you want a block of code repeated over and over again
until a certain condition is satisfied. This can be done by creating a loop. A
loop is a repetitive cycle of a block of code until the condition is met.
In JS, there are a variety of loops:
1. For loop – it loops through a block of code within a specified number of
times.
2. While loop – It loops through a block of code until the condition is
satisfied.
3. Do-while loop – It is like while loop; however, it will execute the set of
codes at least one.
4. For-in loop – It loops through the elements of an array. </td>
